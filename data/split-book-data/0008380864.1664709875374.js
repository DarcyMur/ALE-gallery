And in Baker Street, a mysterious locksmith exacts an unusual price to open a small silver box sent to Watson.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>From the glow of London’s theatre district to the buzzing Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge where physicists explore the edges of the new science of electricity, Holmes and Watson race between the two cities to solve the murders, encountering prevaricating prestidigitators, philandering physicists and murderous mentalists, all the while unlocking secrets which may be best left undisclosed. And one, in particular, is very close to home.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>";
