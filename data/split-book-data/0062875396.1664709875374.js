Nicknamed \"El Draque\" by the Spaniards who placed a bounty on his head, the notorious red-haired, hot-tempered Drake pillaged galleons laden with New World gold and silver, stealing a vast fortune for his queen - and himself. For Elizabeth, Drake made the impossible real, serving as a crucial and brilliantly adaptable instrument of her ambitions to transform England from a third-rate island kingdom into a global imperial power.</p> <p>In 1580, sailing on Elizabeth's covert orders, Drake became the first captain to&nbsp;circumnavigate the earth successfully. (Ferdinand&nbsp;Magellan had died in his attempt.) Part exploring expedition, part raiding mission, Drake's audacious around-the-world journey in the&nbsp;<i>Golden Hind&nbsp;</i>reached&nbsp;Patagonia, the Pacific Coast of present-day California and Oregon, the Spice Islands, Java, and Africa. Almost a decade&nbsp;later, Elizabeth called upon Drake again. As the devil-may-care vice admiral of the English fleet, Drake dramatically defeated the once-invincible Spanish Armada, spurring&nbsp;the British Empire’s ascent and permanently wounding its greatest rival.&nbsp;</p> <p>The relationship between Drake and Elizabeth&nbsp;is the missing link in our understanding of the rise&nbsp;of the British Empire, and its importance has not&nbsp;been fully described or appreciated. Framed around&nbsp;Drake’s key voyages as a window into this crucial&nbsp;moment in British history,&nbsp;<i>In Search of a Kingdom&nbsp;</i>is a rousing adventure narrative entwining epic&nbsp;historical themes with intimate passions.</p> <p>Supplemental enhancement PDF accompanies the audiobook.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying reference material will be available in your Library section along with the audio. </b>&nbsp;</p>";
