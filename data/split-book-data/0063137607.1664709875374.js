The island is locked down, no one is allowed on or off, and it soon becomes horribly clear that a murderer lurks in their midst. But who?</p> <p>Both a brilliant satire on the world of books and writers and an immensely enjoyable locked-room mystery, this audiobook is a triumph - a riddle of a story full of brilliant misdirection, beautifully set-out clues, and diabolically clever denouements.</p>";
