What it was really like engaging in do-or-die dogfights over Nazi Europe. How after being shot&nbsp;down over occupied France, Yeager somehow managed to escape.&nbsp;The amazing behind-the-scenes story of smashing the sound barrier despite cracked ribs from a riding accident days before.&nbsp;</p> <p>The entire story is here, in Yeager’s own words, and in wonderful insights from his wife and those friends and colleagues who have known him best. It is the personal and public story of a man who settled for nothing less than excellence.</p>";
