window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Candid and compelling, <i>A Bigger Picture </i>is the definitive narrative of Malcolm Turnbull’s prime ministership. He describes how he legalised same-sex marriage, established Snowy Hydro 2.0, stood up to Donald Trump and many achievements – remarkable in their pace and significance, and that they were delivered in the teeth of so much opposition.&nbsp;</p> <p>But it’s far more than just politics. Turnbull’s life has been filled with colourful characters and controversies, success and failure. From his early years in Sydney, growing up with a single father, to defending ‘Spycatcher’ Peter Wright against the UK government; the years representing Kerry Packer, leading the Republican Movement and making millions in business; and finally toppling Tony Abbott to become Prime Minister of Australia. For the first time he tells it all - in his own words.&nbsp;</p> <p>With revelatory insights on the workings of Canberra and the contentious events of Turnbull’s life, <i>A Bigger Picture </i>explores the strengths and vulnerabilities of one of Australia’s best-known and most dynamic business and political leaders.</p>";
