A blinding toothache sends Hamish Macbeth 120 miles out of Lochdubh to the infamous dentist’s door. Unfortunately for Hamish and Gilchrist, someone has canceled all the doctor’s appointments - permanently. Since everyone is pleased the dentist is deceased - patients, several harassed women, and even his wife - Macbeth faces one of the more biting challenges of his career.</p> <p>A toothache can drive a man mad, and Hamish, with a mouth full of throbbing pain, decides to go after the killer alone.</p>";
