Let narrator Scott Brick tell you all about it.... Brick can make a nursery rhyme sound exciting, and he's on fire in this audiobook.\" (</b><b><i>AudioFile</i></b><b> magazine) </b></p> <p><b>The best-selling authors of </b><b><i>The First Conspiracy</i></b><b>, which covers the secret plot against George Washington, now turn their attention to a little-known, but true story about a failed assassination attempt on President Lincoln</b></p> <p>Everyone knows the story of Abraham Lincoln's assassination in 1865, but few are aware of the original conspiracy to kill him four years earlier in 1861, literally on his way to Washington, DC, for his first inauguration. The conspirators were part of a pro-Southern secret society that didn't want an antislavery President in the White House. They planned an elaborate scheme to assassinate the brand new President in Baltimore as Lincoln's inauguration train passed through en route to the Capitol. The plot was investigated by famed detective Allan Pinkerton, who infiltrated the group with undercover agents, including one of the first female private detectives in America. Had the assassination succeeded, there would have been no Lincoln Presidency, and the course of the Civil War and American history would have forever been altered.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>A Macmillan Audio production from Flatiron Books</b></p> <p><b>\"</b><b><i>The Lincoln Conspiracy</i></b><b> is, despite its dark subject matter, relentlessly fun to read...It's an expertly crafted book that seems sure to delight readers with an interest in lesser-known episodes of American history.\" (NPR.org)</b></p> <p><b>\"Filled with amazing American history, secret societies, incredible research, and a shocking conspiracy to murder Abraham Lincoln at the dawn of his presidency.
