window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The third volume of Gore Vidal's magnificent series of historical novels aimed at demythologizing the American past, <i>1876</i> chronicles the political scandals and dark intrigues that rocked the United States in its centennial year.</p> <p>Charles Schermerhorn Schuyler, Aaron Burr's unacknowledged son, returns to a flamboyant America after his long, self-imposed European exile. The narrator of <i>Burr</i> has come home to recoup a lost fortune by arranging a suitable marriage for his beautiful daughter, the widowed Princess d'Agrigente, and by ingratiating himself with Samuel Tilden, the favored presidential candidate in the centennial year. With these ambitions and with their own abundant charms, Schuyler and his daughter soon find themselves at the centers of American social and political power at a time when the fading ideals of the young republic were being replaced by the excitement of empire.</p> <p>\"A glorious piece of writing,\" said Jimmy Breslin in <i>Harper's</i>. \"Vidal can take history and make it powerful and astonishing.\" <i>Time</i> concurred: \"Vidal has no peers at breathing movement and laughter into the historical past.\"</p>";
