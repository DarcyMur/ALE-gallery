While nonviolent direct action is remembered as an unassailable part of American democracy, the movement's militancy is either vilified or erased outright.&nbsp;</p> <p>In <i>The Sword and the Shield</i>, Peniel E. Joseph upends these misconceptions and reveals a nuanced portrait of two men who, despite markedly different backgrounds, inspired and pushed each other throughout their adult lives. This is a strikingly revisionist biography, not only of Malcolm and Martin, but also of the movement and era they came to define.</p>";
