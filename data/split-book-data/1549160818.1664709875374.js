Then make it better.</p> <p>I am 93. I've had an extraordinary life. It's only now that I appreciate how extraordinary. As a young man, I felt I was out there in the wild, experiencing the untouched natural world - but it was an illusion. The tragedy of our time has been happening all around us, barely noticeable from day to day - the loss of our planet's wild places, its biodiversity. I have been witness to this decline. <i>A Life on Our Planet</i> is my witness statement and my vision for the future. It is the story of how we came to make this, our greatest mistake - and how, if we act now, we can yet put it right.</p> <p>We have one final chance to create the perfect home for ourselves and restore the wonderful world we inherited.</p> <p>All we need is the will to do so.&nbsp;</p>";
