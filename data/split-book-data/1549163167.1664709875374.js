Waiting on the other side in East Berlin were dozens of men, women, and children - all willing to risk everything to escape.</p> <p>From the award-winning creator of the acclaimed BBC Radio 4 podcast,&nbsp;<i>Tunnel 29</i>&nbsp;is the true story of this most remarkable Cold War rescue mission. Drawing on interviews with the survivors and Stasi files, Helena Merriman brilliantly reveals the stranger-than-fiction story of the ingenious group of student-diggers, the glamorous red-haired messenger, the Stasi spy who threatened the whole enterprise, and the love story that became its surprising epilogue.</p> <p><i>Tunnel 29</i> was also the first made-for-TV event of its kind; it was funded by NBC, who wanted to film an escape in real time. Their documentary - which was nearly blocked from airing by the Kennedy administration, which wanted to control the media during the Cold War - revolutionized TV journalism.</p> <p>Ultimately, <i>Tunnel 29</i>&nbsp;is a success story about freedom: the valiant citizens risking everything to win it back, and the larger world rooting for them to triumph.</p>";
