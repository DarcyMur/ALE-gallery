As Farrow drew closer to the truth, shadowy operatives, from high-priced lawyers to elite war-hardened spies, mounted a secret campaign of intimidation, threatening his career, following his every move, and weaponizing an account of abuse in his own family. This is the untold story of the exotic tactics of surveillance and intimidation deployed by wealthy and connected men to threaten journalists, evade accountability, and silence victims of abuse. And it’s the story of the women who risked everything to expose the truth and spark a global movement.</p> <p><b><i>Los Angeles Times</i></b> <b>Book Prize Finalist</b><br> <b> Finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award in Autobiography</b><br> <b> IndieBound number one best seller</b><br> <b><i>USA Today</i></b> <b>best seller</b><br> <b><i>Wall Street Journal</i></b> <b>best seller</b></p>";
