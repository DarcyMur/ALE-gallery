Soviets kept files on all foreigners, studied their patterns, and tapped their phones. Intelligence work was effectively impossible. The Soviet threat loomed larger than ever.</p> <p><i>The Moscow Rules </i>tells the story of the intelligence breakthroughs that turned the odds in America's favor. As experts in disguise, Antonio and Jonna were instrumental in developing a series of tactics - Hollywood-inspired identity swaps, ingenious evasion techniques, and an armory of James Bond-style gadgets - that allowed CIA officers to outmaneuver the KGB.</p> <p>As Russia again rises in opposition to America, this remarkable story is a tribute to those who risked everything for their country and to the ingenuity that allowed them to succeed.</p>";
