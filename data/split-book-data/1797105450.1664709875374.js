Roosevelt’s death. In an instant, Vice President Harry Truman, who has been kept out of war planning and knows nothing of the top-secret Manhattan Project to develop the world’s first atomic bomb, must assume command of a nation at war on multiple continents - and confront one of the most consequential decisions in history. <i>Countdown 1945</i> tells the gripping true story of the turbulent days, weeks, and months to follow, leading up to August 6, 1945, when Truman gives the order to drop the bomb on Hiroshima.</p> <p>In <i>Countdown 1945</i>, Chris Wallace, the veteran journalist and anchor of <i>Fox News Sunday</i>, takes listeners inside the minds of the iconic and elusive figures who join the quest for the bomb, each for different reasons: the legendary Albert Einstein, who eventually calls his vocal support for the atomic bomb \"the one great mistake in my life\"; lead researcher J. Robert \"Oppie\" Oppenheimer and the Soviet spies who secretly infiltrate his team; the fiercely competitive pilots of the plane selected to drop the bomb; and many more.</p> <p>Perhaps most of all, <i>Countdown 1945</i> is the story of an untested new president confronting a decision that he knows will change the world forever.&nbsp;</p> <p>But more than a book about the atomic bomb, <i>Countdown 1945</i> is also an unforgettable account of the lives of ordinary American and Japanese civilians in wartime - from \"Calutron Girls\" like Ruth Sisson in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, to 10-year-old Hiroshima resident Hideko Tamura, who survives the blast at ground zero but loses her mother and later immigrates to the United States, where she lives to this day - as well as American soldiers fighting in the Pacific, waiting in fear for the order to launch a possible invasion of Japan.</p> <p>Told with vigor, intelligence, and humanity, <i>Countdown 1945</i> is the definitive account of one of the most significant moments in history.</p>";
