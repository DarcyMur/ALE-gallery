Desperate to beat the Russians into space, NASA put together a crew of the nation's most daring test pilots: the seven men who were to lead America to the moon. The first into space was Alan Shepard; the last was Deke Slayton, whose irregular heartbeat kept him grounded until 1975. They spent the 1960s at the forefront of NASA's effort to conquer space, and <i>Moon Shot</i> is their inside account of what many call the 20th century's greatest feat - landing humans on another world.</p> <p>Collaborating with NBC's veteran space reporter Jay Barbree, Shepard, and Slayton narrate, in gripping detail, the story of America's space exploration from the time of Shepard's first flight until he and 11 others had walked on the moon.</p>";
