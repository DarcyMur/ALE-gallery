All of Beryl's ex-husbands have proven reluctant to part with her alimony, which is most inconvenient. So when the local vicar - and pigeon-racing club president - approaches them with a private inquiry opportunity, the ladies eagerly accept. There's been a spot of bother: The treasurer has absconded with the club's funds and several prized birds. Beryl and Edwina hope to flush out the missing man by checking his boardinghouse and place of employment at the coal mine.&nbsp;</p> <p>But when they visit the man's loft, they find their elusive quarry lying in white feathers and a pool of crimson blood, stabbed to death - the only witnesses cooing mournfully. After a stiff gin fizz, the ladies resume their search for the missing funds and prized birds - and now a murderer. Beryl and Edwina aren't shy about ruffling a few feathers as they home in on their suspects. But they had better find the killer fast, before their sleuthing career is cut short.</p>";
