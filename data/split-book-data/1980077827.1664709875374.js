To this day, no one knows why. </b></p> <p>The <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of the Aimee Leduc investigations reimagines history in her masterful, pulse-pounding spy thriller, <i>Three Hours in Paris</i>.&nbsp;</p> <p>Kate Rees, a young American markswoman, has been recruited by British intelligence to drop into Paris with a dangerous assignment: assassinate the Fuhrer. Wrecked by grief after a Luftwaffe bombing killed her husband and infant daughter, she is armed with a rifle, a vendetta, and a fierce resolve. But other than rushed and rudimentary instruction, she has no formal spy training. Thrust into the red-hot center of the war, a country girl from rural Oregon finds herself holding the fate of the world in her hands. When Kate misses her mark and the plan unravels, Kate is on the run for her life - all the time wrestling with the suspicion that the whole operation was a set-up.&nbsp;</p> <p>Cara Black, doyenne of the Parisian crime novel, is at her best as she brings Occupation-era France to vivid life in this gripping story about one young woman with the temerity - and drive - to take on Hitler himself.</p>";
