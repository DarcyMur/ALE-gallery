Created in 1951 to ensure the future of an embattled Israel, Mossad is responsible for the most audacious and thrilling feats of espionage, counterterrorism, and assassination. To some, Mossad is the precise and at times lethal instrument of Israel's will, a fiercely dedicated group of men and women: an elite intelligence arm.

But no one has ever gotten close enough to Mossad to know the truth. Until now.</p> <p><i>Gideon's Spies</i> documents the Mossad's deepest secrets from the end of the Cold War to the present day.
