window.bookSummaryJSON = "Cokie Roberts's #1 <i>New York Times</i> best seller <i>We Are Our Mothers' Daughters</i> examined the nature of women's roles throughout history and led <i>USA Today</i> to praise her as a \"custodian of time-honored values.\" Her second best seller, <i>From This Day Forward</i>, written with her husband, Steve Roberts, described American marriages throughout history. Now Cokie returns with <i>Founding Mothers</i>, an intimate look at the passionate women whose tireless pursuits on behalf of their families and country proved just as crucial to the forging of a new nation as the rebellion that established it. <p>Roberts reveals the often surprising stories of these fascinating women, bringing to life the everyday trials of individuals like Abigail Adams, Mercy Otis Warren, Eliza Pinckney, Mary Bartlett, and Martha Washington, proving that without our exemplary women, the new country might have never survived.</p> <p>Social history at its best, <i>Founding Mothers</i> unveils the determination, creative insight, and passion of the other patriots, the women who raised our nation. Cokie Roberts proves beyond doubt that like every generation of American women that has followed, the founding mothers used the unique gifts of their gender (courage, pluck, sadness, joy, energy, grace, sensitivity, and humor) to do what women do best, put one foot in front of the other in remarkable circumstances, and carry on.</p>";
