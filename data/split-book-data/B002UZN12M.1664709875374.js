window.bookSummaryJSON = "Presenting an aspect of American history that has never been fully told, Doris Kearns Goodwin describes how the isolationist and divided United States of 1940 was unified under the extraordinary leadership of Franklin Roosevelt to become, only five years later, the preeminent economic and military power in the world. Using diaries, interviews, and White House records, Goodwin paints an intimate, detailed portrait not only of the presidency during wartime but also Franklin and Eleanor themselves, as well as their friends, advisers, and family. Bringing to bear the tools of both history and biography, <i>No Ordinary Time</i> relates the unique story of how FDR led the nation to victory in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds and, with Eleanor's essential help, forever changed the fabric of American society. <p>Listen to Doris Kearns Goodwin talk about this book on C-SPAN's <i>Booknotes</i> (10/25/94).</p>";
