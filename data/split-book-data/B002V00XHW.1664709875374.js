window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Michael Palin's diaries begin in the late 1960s when he began writing for hugely popular programs. He recounts how <i>Monty Python</i> emerged and triumphed. From the success and cult status brought by <i>Monty Python</i>, Palin shares stories from their world tours, their stay at hotels recently trashed by Led Zeppelin, their battles over censorship, and how individually the Pythons went their separate ways. Yet at the same time they were working on the now celebrated series of films, including<i> The Holy Grail</i>, many of whose lines are known by heart to a considerable portion of the English-speaking world.&nbsp;</p> <p>The birth and childhood of his three children, learning to cope as a young man with celebrity, his friendship with George Harrison, and all the trials of a peripatetic life are also essential ingredients of these diaries. A perceptive and funny chronicle, the diaries are a rich portrait of a fascinating period.</p>";
