window.bookSummaryJSON = "It was one of the most traumatic events in maritime history, and Archibald Gracie was probably among the last to leave the sinking <i>Titanic</i> on that cold April night in 1912. In this unique account, he describes his personal experiences and remarkable escape from death in the icy waters of the Atlantic, painting a vivid picture of what it was like on board the <i>Titanic</i> in its final hours. <p> Tracking down other survivors for their stories and attending court hearings to obtain the official record, Colonel Gracie filled in the details of his account, struggling to complete it in spite of illness. Largely due to the effects of his ordeal and exposure in the frigid Atlantic, he finally succumbed on December 4, 1912. His book was published in 1913 to universal acclaim and remains one of the most vivid first-hand accounts of the disaster.</p>";
