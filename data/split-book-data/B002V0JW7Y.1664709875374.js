Lucid, dramatic, remarkable for its breadth and sweep and for its sense of personal involvement, it is universally acknowledged as a magnificent reconstruction. <b>Please note:</b> This book was originally published in six volumes: </p> <p>1.<i>The Gathering Storm</i> <br>2. <i>Their Finest Hour</i> <br>3. <i>The Grand Alliance</i> <br>4. <i>The Hinge of Fate</i><br>5. <i>Closing the Ring</i> <br>6. <i>Triumph and Tragedy</i></p> <p>Churchill then condensed these into four volumes, which have since been released as one, rather hefty, publication. Audible has published the unabridged recordings of Churchill's condensed volume, divided into four parts, as follows: </p> <p>1.<i>Milestone to Disaster</i> <br>2.<i>Alone</i> <br>3.<i>The Grand Alliance</i> <br>4.<i>Triumph and Tragedy</i> <br></p>";
