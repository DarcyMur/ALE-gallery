window.bookSummaryJSON = "The extraordinary new Gabriel Allon novel from the \"gold standard\" ( <i>The Dallas Morning New</i>) of thriller writers. <p>Over the course of ten previous novels, Daniel Silva has established himself as one of the world's finest writers of international intrigue and espionage- \"a worthy successor to such legends as Frederick Forsyth and John le Carr√©\" (<i>Chicago Sun-Times</i>)-and Gabriel Allon as \"one of the most intriguing heroes of any thriller series\" (<i>The Philadelphia Inquirer</i>).</p> <p>Now the death of a journalist leads Allon to Russia, where he finds that, in terms of spycraft, even he has something to learn. He's playing by Moscow rules now.</p> <p>This is not the grim, gray Moscow of Soviet times but a new Moscow, awash in oil wealth and choked with bulletproof Bentleys. A Moscow where power resides once more behind the walls of the Kremlin and where critics of the ruling class are ruthlessly silenced. A Moscow where a new generation of Stalinists is plotting to reclaim an empire lost and to challenge the global dominance of its old enemy, the United States.</p> <p>One such man is Ivan Kharkov, a former KGB colonel who built a global investment empire on the rubble of the Soviet Union. Hidden within that empire, however, is a more lucrative and deadly business: Kharkov is an arms dealer-and he is about to deliver Russia's most sophisticated weapons to al- Qaeda. Unless Allon can learn the time and place of the delivery, the world will see the deadliest terror attacks since 9/11-and the clock is ticking fast.</p> <p>Filled with rich prose and breathtaking turns of plot, <i>Moscow Rules</i> is at once superior entertainment and a searing cautionary tale about the new threats rising to the East-and Silva's finest novel yet.</p>";
