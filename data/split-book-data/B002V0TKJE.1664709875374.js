Sigma made sure of that. <p> American investment banker Ben Hartman arrives in Zurich, the first time he's been back to Switzerland since his twin brother died there in a tragic accident four years ago. But when Ben chances upon Jimmy Cavanaugh, an old college friend, Cavanaugh draws a gun and tries to kill him. In minutes, several innocent bystanders are dead, as well as Cavanaugh, and Ben is on the run, plunged into an unspeakable nightmare.</p> <p> U.S. Department of Justice field agent Anna Navarro is being stalked by a relentless killer, managing to survive only by a combination of luck, skill, and her own quick wits. The attacks on her are somehow related to her current assignment: investigating the sudden, seemingly unrelated deaths of a number of very old men around the world. The only thing that connects them is an ancient CIA file bearing the code word Sigma.</p> <p> Brought together by accident, Ben and Anna realize that their only hope of survival lies with each other. Together they race to uncover the long-hidden diabolical secrets of Sigma - secrets that threaten everything they think they know, everything they believed about their friends and families, everything they were taught about history itself. For behind Sigma lies a vast deception that is finally coming to fruition - and the fate of the world is in their hands.</p>";
