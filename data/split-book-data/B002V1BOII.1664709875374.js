We hear Lyndon Johnson as he schemes and blusters, rewards and punishes, and reveals a bedrock core of unshakable political beliefs.</p> <p>The only president to record his private conversations from his first day in office, LBJ ordered these tapes locked in a vault until at least the year 2023. But now they have been unsealed, providing a close-up look at a president taking unprecedented power, from John F. Kennedy's murder in November 1963 to Johnson's campaign for a landslide victory.</p> <p><i>Taking Charge</i> is filled with revelations about the full-blooded Texan behind the public image. You will hear LBJ:</p> <ul> <li>Revealing his self-doubts and personal anguish over the responsibilities of the presidency</li> <li>Receiving the frank criticism of his wife, Lady Bird Johnson</li> <li>Staking his presidency on a revolutionary civil rights bill</li> <li>Scuttling Robert Kennedy's drive to be his vice president</li> <li>Using the Tonkin Gulf attack to expand the American beachhead in Southeast Asia</li> <li>Unveiling his private, tortured early doubts that the US could ever win a war in Vietnam</li> </ul> <p><i>Taking Charge</i> gives us an unprecedented look into a crucial presidency that continues to shape our lives today. In LBJ's own words, it is history \"with the bark off\".</p>";
