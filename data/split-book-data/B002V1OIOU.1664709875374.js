It has been taught in schools as a moral tract, as a guide to self-improvement, and as the Great American Success Story. It also is relished both for its insight into colonial life and the mind of the man who most affected the development of our democratic form of government. Finally, it is savored for its language; Franklin's wit, his well-turned phrase, and his humanity shine through.";
