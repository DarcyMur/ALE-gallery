window.bookSummaryJSON = "Des Moines, Iowa-born writer Bryson's first success was the travel book <i>The Lost Continent</i>. After living in England for several years, he wanted to go back to the USA to find the perfect little US town of his past, he lovingly called Amalgam. More travel books followed, in the form of <i>Neither Here Nor There</i> (where he travels through Europe), <i>Notes From A Small Island</i> (where he travels around the United Kingdom, before returning back to the USA to live there for good) and <i>A Walk In The Woods</i> (where he walks the Appalachian trail). After moving back to the States, Bryson started to write a column for <i>The Mail on Sunday Night and Day</i> magazine. This is a collection of these column entries. Bryson writes about everything from everyday chores, to suing people, the beach, TV, movies, air conditioners, college, Americana, injury dangers, wasting resources, and holiday seasons.";
