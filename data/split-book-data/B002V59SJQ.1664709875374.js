window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Frank W. Abagnale, alias Frank Williams, Robert Conrad, Frank Adams, and Robert Monjo, was one of the most daring con men, forgers, imposters, and escape artists in history. In his brief but notorious criminal career, Abagnale donned a pilot's uniform and copiloted a Pan Am jet, masqueraded as the supervising resident of a hospital, practiced law without a license, passed himself off as a college sociology professor, and cashed over $2.5 million in forged checks, all before he was 21. Known by the police of 26 foreign countries and all 50 states as \"The Skywayman\", Abagnale lived a sumptuous life on the lam - until the law caught up with him.</p> <p>Now recognized as the nation's leading authority on financial foul play, Abagnale is a charming rogue whose hilarious, stranger-than-fiction international escapades and ingenious escapes - including one from an airplane - make <i>Catch Me If You Can</i> an irresistible tale of deceit. It's also a film starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks.</p> <p><b>Please note: This audiobook does not include the last portion of the physical book (epilogue).</b></p>";
