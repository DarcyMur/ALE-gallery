One of its rare major defeats came in the spring of 1964, when a packet of dossiers arrived anonymously at the Ministry of Justice in Bonn.</p> <p>How and why a once carefree young German freelance journalist came to send the packet is told in this brilliant new extrapolation from reality into terror.</p>";
