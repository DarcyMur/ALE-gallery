window.bookSummaryJSON = "In their own words, recorded in the famous journals of Lewis and Clark, the members of the Corps of Discovery tell their story with an immediacy and power missing from secondhand accounts. All of their triumphs and terrors are here: the thrill of seeing the vast herds of bison, the fear the captains felt when Sacagawea fell ill, the ordeal of crossing the Continental Divide, the misery of cold and hunger, and the kidnapping and rescue of Lewis' dog, Seaman. The natural wonders of an unspoiled America are here, and the lives and customs of its native peoples also come vividly to life, making for a living drama that is humorous, poignant, and, at least once, tragic. <p> Editor Gary E. Moulton blends the narrative highlights of his definitive Nebraska edition of the Lewis and Clark journals to bring forth the voices of the enlisted men - and of the Native Americans, heard for the first time alongside the words of the captains.</p>";
