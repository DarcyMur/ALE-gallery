But the Allies had to sink it...or risk losing the war. <p>William Shirer, famed World War II correspondent and author of <i>The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich</i>, captures every suspenseful moment of the perilous mission.

However, a mixture of luck and new technology - including radar - turned the tide in the Allies' favor.</p>";
