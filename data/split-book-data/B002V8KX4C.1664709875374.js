Although left partially paralyzed by polio, he persevered and became a powerful leader during a difficult period in U.S. history. <p>This fascinating biography captures all the drama of F.D.R.'s life and times: his privileged, but somewhat lonely childhood; his marriage to Eleanor, who opened his eyes to social injustice; his introduction to public office; his struggle to stay in politics in spite of his physical disabilities; and the daunting task of being president in a time of national and global turmoil.</p>";
