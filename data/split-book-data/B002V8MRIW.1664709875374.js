A labyrinth of greed, corruption, and betrayal, it is the most darkly humorous of all Conrad's tales. </p> <p>It follows a European secret agent, Adolf Verloc, 'a London shop owner' with anarchist leanings who becomes reluctantly involved in a plot to blow up the Greenwich Observatory. Full of great characters, melodramatic irony and psychological intrigue the tale is far from simple, involving politicians, policemen, foreign diplomats and London's fashionable society. </p> <p>This classic was written at a time when terrorist activity was increasing. Due to its themes of anarchism, espionage, and terrorism, the book still retains great interest from its audience and was regularly cited by the American media after the September 11 attacks. <i>The New York Times</i> described it as acquiring 'a kind of cult status as the classic novel for the post-9/11 age.' </p> <p>Though the story did not attain popularity during Conrad's lifetime it is still considered to be one of his finest novels. </p> <p><i>Narrator Biography</i></p> <p>Having studied at the Central School of Speech and Drama in London, David Horovitch has had a television career spanning over 40 years.
