window.bookSummaryJSON = "Is John McCain \"for real\"? <p>That's the question David Foster Wallace set out to explore when he first climbed aboard Senator John McCain's campaign caravan in February 2000. It was a moment when McCain was increasingly perceived as a harbinger of change, the anticandidate whose goal was \"to inspire young Americans to devote themselves to causes greater than their own self-interest\". And many young Americans were beginning to take notice.</p> <p>To get at \"something riveting and unspinnable and true\" about John McCain, Wallace finds he must pierce the smoke screen of spin doctors and media manipulators. And he succeeds - in a characteristically potent blast of journalistic brio that not only captures the lunatic rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign but also delivers a compelling inquiry into John McCain himself: the senator, the POW, the campaign finance reformer, the candidate, the man.</p>";
