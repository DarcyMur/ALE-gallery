Adams thought, wrote, and spoke out for the \"Great Cause\" come what might; he traveled far and wide in all seasons and often at extreme risk; he rose to become the second president of the United States and saved the country from blundering into an unnecessary war; he was rightly celebrated for his integrity, and regarded by some as \"out of his senses\"; and his marriage to the wise and valiant Abigail Adams is one of the most moving love stories in American history. <p>Much about Adams' life will come as a surprise to many. His rocky relationship with friend and eventual archrival Thomas Jefferson, his courageous voyage on the frigate <i>Boston</i> in the winter of 1778, and his later trek over the Pyrenees are exploits few would have dared and that few listeners will ever forget.</p> <p>McCullough's <i>John Adams</i> has the sweep and vitality of a great novel. This is history on a grand scale, an audiobook about politics, war, and social issues, but also about human nature, love, religious faith, virtue, ambition, friendship, and betrayal, and the far-reaching consequences of noble ideas. Above all, it is an enthralling, often surprising story of one of the most important and fascinating Americans who ever lived.</p>";
