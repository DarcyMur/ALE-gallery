Like many other small cities in this ever-evolving country, Fuling is heading down a new path of change and growth, which came into remarkably sharp focus when Peter Hessler arrived as a Peace Corps volunteer, marking the first time in more than half a century that the city had an American resident. Hessler taught English and American literature at the local college, but it was his students who taught him about the complex processes of understanding that take place when one is immersed in a radically different society.</p> <p>Poignant, thoughtful, funny, and enormously compelling, <i>River Town</i> is an unforgettable portrait of a city that is seeking to understand both what it was and what it someday will be. </p>";
