They called their new club the Ku Klux Klan, and it quickly grew into the self-proclaimed Invisible Empire, with secret dens spreading across the South.</p> <p>Award-winning author Susan Campbell Bartoletti weaves together vivid personal accounts from oral histories, congressional documents, and diaries in this enlightening, surprising, and disquieting story, which has received a slew of starred reviews from <i>Kirkus, Publisher’s Weekly, Booklist</i>, and other esteemed publications. Her extensive research places the length of the Klan’s history into a larger context that sheds new light on the roots of hate groups.</p> <p><b>When you purchase </b><b><i>They Called Themselves the KKK</i></b><b>, you’ll get exclusive bonus audio from a conversation with the author and Audie Award-winning narrator Dion Graham.</b></p>";
