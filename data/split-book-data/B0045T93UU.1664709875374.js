Forester's hero returns, ready to embark on his next swashbuckling adventure. </p> <p>The fifth instalment in the series, <i>The Happy Return</i> follows Captain Horatio Hornblower as he commands the thirty-six-gun frigate, <i>HMS Lydia</i>. Sent out on a mission to weaken the colonial Spanish government, Horatio must form an alliance with a narcissistic revolutionary leader with delusions of grandeur, who goes by the name of 'El Supremo'. </p> <p>Simultaneously faced with an advancing Spanish fleet and their far superior fifty-gun ship, <i>Natividad</i>, Horatio must find a way to 'take, sink, burn or destroy' his enemies or fail and be made to face the British courts. Adding insult to injury, Horatio is furthermore challenged by the arrival of a singularly attractive passenger, the influential Lady Barbara Wellesley. Vulnerable, alone and seeking passage to England, Horatio cannot refuse the lady, but as a happily married man, he finds himself tortured by Barbara's tempting nature and astounding beauty. </p> <p>An English novelist, C.S. Forester was highly praised by his contemporaries for his Napoleonic naval warfare series, and later for the publication of <i>The African Queen</i>. </p> <p>Despite his natural ability and endless imagination, Forester came to writing much later than expected. Having originally studied medicine at Guy's Hospital, it was only after his travels with the Royal Navy that he was artistically inspired, developing in particular, a fervent love of story-telling. Sadly stricken with arteriosclerosis whilst voyaging to the Bering Sea, C.S. Forester was crippled in his later life, but his imagination and his skill with a pen survived for years to come. </p> <p><i>Narrator Biography</i> </p> <p>Christian Rodska is an English television and voice actor best known for his role in the 1970s series <i>Follyfoot</i>. </p> <p>From <i>The Monuments Men</i> and <i>The Eagle of the Ninth</i> to <i>The Likely Lads</i>, <i>Z Cars</i>, <i>The Tomorrow People</i>, <i>Coronation Street</i>, <i>Bergerac</i> and <i>Casualty</i>, his extensive and diverse acting career has led him to become a highly solicited radio and audiobook narrator. </p> <p>He has now voiced over 150 unabridged audiobooks including Winston Churchill's biographies, Evelyn Waugh's <i>Men at Arms</i> and Sebastian Faulks' <i>A Possible Life</i>.
