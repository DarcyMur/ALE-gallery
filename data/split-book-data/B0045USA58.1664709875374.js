Estimated to be the 'the ugliest and least desirable two-decker in the Navy List,' Hornblower's first ship of the line is far from becoming the vessel of his dreams, and being 250 men short of a full crew, the captain is forced to enlist and train a rabble of 'poachers, bigamists and sheep stealers.' </p> <p>Seventeen years into the Napoleonic wars, Hornblower cannot afford to pause or make mistakes and the pressure soon mounts as the French approach the Catalonian shores. </p> <p>Winner of the 1938 James Tait Black Memorial Prize for Fiction, <i>A Ship of the Line</i> delivers an action-packed seafaring adventure as one of the nation's favourite captains takes the lead once again. </p> <p>Hugely celebrated for his Napoleonic naval warfare series, and later for the publication of <i>The African Queen</i>, C. S. Forester came to writing much later than expected. Having originally studied medicine at Guy's Hospital, Forester first developed a love of story-telling after being inspired by his travels with the Royal Navy. </p> <p>Sadly stricken with arteriosclerosis whilst voyaging to the Bering Sea, C.S. Forester was crippled in his later life, but his imagination and his skill with a pen survived for years to come. </p> <p><i>Narrator Biography</i> </p> <p>Christian Rodska is an English television and voice actor best known for his role in the 1970s series <i>Follyfoot</i>. </p> <p>From <i>The Monuments Men</i> and <i>The Eagle of the Ninth</i> to <i>The Likely Lads</i>, <i>Z Cars</i>, <i>The Tomorrow People</i>, <i>Coronation Street</i>, <i>Bergerac</i> and <i>Casualty</i>, his extensive and diverse acting career has led him to become a highly solicited radio and audiobook narrator. </p> <p>He has now voiced over 150 unabridged audiobooks including Winston Churchill's biographies, Evelyn Waugh's <i>Men at Arms</i> and Sebastian Faulks' <i>A Possible Life</i>.
