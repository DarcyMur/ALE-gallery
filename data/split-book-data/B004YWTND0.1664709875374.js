He is also not what he appears to be. As acclaimed author Jon Krakauer discovered, Mortenson has not only fabricated substantial parts of his best-selling books <i>Three Cups of Tea</i> and <i>Stones into Schools</i>, but has also misused millions of dollars donated by unsuspecting admirers like Krakauer himself. </p> <p>This is the tragic tale of good intentions gone very wrong. </p> <p>100% of Jon Krakauer's proceeds from the sale of <i>Three Cups of Deceit</i> will be donated to the \"Stop Girl Trafficking\" project at the American Himalayan Foundation (www.himalayan-foundation.org/live/project/stopgirltrafficking).</p>";
