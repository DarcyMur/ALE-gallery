window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In this darkly comical look at the sinister side of our relationship with the natural world, Stewart has tracked down over one hundred of our worst entomological foes - creatures that infest, infect, and generally wreak havoc on human affairs. From the world's most painful hornet, to the flies that transmit deadly diseases, to millipedes that stop traffic, to the Japanese beetles munching on your roses, <i>Wicked Bugs</i> delves into the extraordinary powers of many-legged creatures. </p> <p>With wit, style, and exacting research, Stewart has uncovered the most terrifying and titillating stories of bugs gone wild. It's an A to Z of insect enemies, interspersed with sections that explore bugs with kinky sex lives, creatures lurking in the cupboard, militant ants, and phobias that feed our (sometimes) irrational responses to bugs. </p> <p><i>Wicked Bugs</i> is a fascinating mixture of history, science, murder, and intrigue that begins - but doesn't end - in your own backyard.</p>";
