And of course the epitome of Western imperialism is the British Empire, the biggest empire the world has ever known, covering at its height a quarter of the globe’s surface and ruling a quarter of the world’s population. Here, best-selling author H. W. Crocker III exposes—in brawling, rambunctious style—how the British Empire was actually one of the greatest establishers and defenders of freedom in history. </p> <p>So strap on your pith helmet for a rollicking ride through some of history’s most colorful events. <i>The Politically Incorrect Guide to the British Empire</i> provides a panoramic and provocative view of 400 years of history that will delight and amuse, educate and entertain.</p>";
