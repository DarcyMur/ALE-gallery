Subsequent immigrants didn't confront or assimilate into an \"American\" or \"Canadian\" culture, but rather into one of the 11 distinct regional ones that spread over the continent, each staking out mutually exclusive territory. </p> <p>In <i>American Nations</i>, Colin Woodard leads us on a journey through the history of our fractured continent and the rivalries and alliances between its component nations, which conform to neither state nor international boundaries. He illustrates and explains why \"American\" values vary sharply from one region to another. </p> <p>Woodard reveals how intranational differences have played a pivotal role at every point in the continent's history, from the American Revolution and the Civil War to the tumultuous sixties and the \"blue county/red county\" maps of recent presidential elections. <i>American Nations</i> is a revolutionary and revelatory take on America's myriad identities and how the conflicts between them have shaped our past and are molding our future.</p>";
