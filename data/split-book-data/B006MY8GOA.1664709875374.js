He witnessed and documented the end of the old American West and the beginning of the modern age, which picked new winners and losers. Adventurous author, passionate Indian rights activist, pioneering reporter, workaholic newspaper editor, librarian, poet, anthropologist and archeologist, Charles Fletcher Lummis was a great colorful individualist, who explored and popularized the facts and legends of the American Southwest. </p> <p>In this first person narrative, never before recorded as an audio book, Lummis describes the invasion of the West by investors, forcing out small miners and ranchers. He sees the last of the buffalo, is nearly murdered by prisoners, visits the Southwest Indian pueblos before there were highways, befriends a dog who goes mad, performs self surgery while alone in the wild, is nearly frozen in a blizzard and meets the great colorful characters of the American West.</p>";
