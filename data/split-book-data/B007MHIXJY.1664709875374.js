It is also armed with nuclear weapons. Between 150,000 and 200,000 people are being held in its political prison camps, which have existed twice as long as Stalin’s Soviet gulags and twelve times as long as the Nazi concentration camps. Very few born and raised in these camps have escaped - but Shin Dong-hyuk did. </p> <p>In&nbsp;<i>Escape from Camp 14,</i> acclaimed journalist Blaine Harden tells the story of Shin Dong-hyuk and, through the lens of Shin’s life, unlocks the secrets of the world’s most repressive totalitarian state. Shin knew nothing of civilized existence: he saw his mother as a competitor for food, guards raised him to be a snitch, and he witnessed the execution of his own family. Through Harden’s harrowing narrative of Shin’s life and remarkable escape, he offers an unequaled inside account of one of the world’s darkest nations and a riveting tale of endurance, courage, and survival. </p> <p>Blaine Harden is a contributor to the <i>Economist</i> and has formerly served as the <i>Washington Post</i>’s bureau chief in East Asia, Eastern Europe, and Africa. He is the author of <i>Africa: Dispatches from a Fragile Continent</i> and <i>A River Lost: The Life and Death of the Columbia.</i> He lives in Seattle, Washington.</p>";
