Bouton was called a Judas, a Benedict Arnold and a “social leper” for having violated the “sanctity of the clubhouse.” Baseball commissioner Bowie Kuhn tried to force Bouton to sign a statement saying the book wasn’t true. Ballplayers, most of whom hadn’t read it, denounced the book. It was even banned by a few libraries.</p> <p>Almost everyone else, however, loved <i>Ball Four</i>. Fans liked discovering that athletes were real people--often wildly funny people. Many readers said it gave them strength to get through a difficult period in their lives. Serious critics called it an important document.</p> <p>David Halberstam, who won a Pulitzer for his reporting on Vietnam, wrote a piece in Harper’s that said of Bouton: “He has written… a book deep in the American vein, so deep in fact that it is by no means a sports book.”</p> <p>In 1999 <i>Ball Four</i> was selected by the New York Public Library as one of the “Books of the Century.” And <i>Time</i> magazine chose it as one of the \"100 Greatest Non-Fiction\" books.</p> <p>Besides changing the image of athletes, the book played a role in the economic revolution in pro sports. In 1975, <i>Ball Four</i> was accepted as legal evidence against the owners at the arbitration hearing, which lead to free agency in baseball and, by extension, to other sports.</p> <p>Today <i>Ball Four</i> has taken on another role--as a time capsule of life in the 60s. \"It is not just a diary of Bouton's 1969 season with the Seattle Pilots and Houston Astros,\" says sportswriter Jim Caple. \"It's a vibrant, funny, telling history of an era that seems even further away than four decades. To call it simply a \"tell all book\" is like describing <i>The Grapes of Wrath</i> as a book about harvesting peaches in California.\"</p>";
