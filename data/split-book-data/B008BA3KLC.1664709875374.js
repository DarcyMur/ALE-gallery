window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In this second entry from <i>The New York Times</i> best-selling series by Rita Mae Brown and Sneaky Pie Brown, the citizens of Crozet, Virginia, reap a gruesome harvest - of human body parts. </p> <p>Ever since her husband’s affair, Mary Minor “Harry” Haristeen has taken a sabbatical from men. The 30-ish divorcée is content to tend her farm and gain a bird’s-eye view of the neighbors from her perch as small-town postmistress. Yet when a hunky city slicker comes to town with no clue about farming, she’s happy to show him the ropes. When pieces of a dismembered body crop up around Crozet, however, the wary townsfolk reckon the handsome stranger is the culprit. But as Harry and her sleuthing pets - Mrs. Murphy the cat and Tee Tucker the dog - sniff out the clues, they have other notions. </p> <p>While the unique trio follows a curious trail, Kate Forbes’ charming narration captures the spirit of each colorful character - whether human, feline, or canine.</p>";
