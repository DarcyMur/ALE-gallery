Here is a remarkable rendering of that fateful time, told with humanity and humor. <i>Decision in Philadelphia</i> is the best popular history of the Constitutional Convention; in it, the life and times of 18th-century America not only come alive, but the very human qualities of the men who framed the document are brought provocatively into focus - casting many of the Founding Fathers in a new light. A celebration of how and why our Constitution came into being, <i>Decision in Philadelphia</i> is also a testament of the American spirit at its finest.</p>";
