window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In this collection of Rumpole stories the comic, courageous, and corpulent 'great defender of muddled and sinful humanity' is joined by a winning cast of villains and victims in tales whose wry humour and sparkling wit deftly send up the legal system. In Rumpole and the Angel of Death our hero achieves resounding triumphs over the forces of prejudice and mean-mindedness. Rumpole and the Way through the Woods involves Rumpole in the world of hunters and the hunted, animal rights and human wrongs. In Rumpole and the Rights of Man, he finds at the European Court of Human Rights that international justice is as fallible as the domestic variety. And for the first time, Hilda, She Who Must Be Obeyed, tells a story all her own.</p>";
