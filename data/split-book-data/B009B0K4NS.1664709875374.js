window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Here are six delightful tales featuring everyone’s favorite barrister for the defense, Horace Rumpole. Eccentric characters such as his wife, Hilda, otherwise known as “She Who Must Be Obeyed”, and his philandering colleague Claude Erskine-Brown are back as Rumpole visits a snooty restaurant where he engages in a battle of wills over his adored mashed spuds, takes the unaccustomed role of prosecutor, and ventures - unwillingly - onto a ship, where he confronts, of all things, a detective novelist. </p> <p>Included are “Rumpole&nbsp;à&nbsp;la Carte”, “Rumpole and the Summer of Discontent”, “Rumpole and the Right to Silence”, “Rumpole at Sea”, “Rumpole and the Quacks”, and “Rumpole for the Prosecution”. </p> <p>This masterly blend of humor and mystery makes for irresistible listening. </p> <p>About the author: John Mortimer (1923-2009) was a playwright, novelist, and barrister. He wrote many radio, film, and television scripts, including the British television series <i>Rumpole of the Bailey</i>, and won the British Academy Writer of the Year Award in 1979.
