window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In 2003, software engineer David Miller left his job, family, and friends to hike 2,172 miles of the Appalachian Trail. <i>AWOL on the Appalachian Trail</i> is Miller’s account of this thru-hike from Georgia to Maine. Listeners are treated to rich descriptions of the Appalachian Mountains, the isolation and reverie, the inspiration that fueled his quest, and the rewards of taking a less conventional path through life. While this book abounds with introspection and perseverance, it also provides useful passages about hiking gear and planning. This is not merely a travel guide; it is a beautifully written and highly personal view into one man’s journey and the insights gained by abandoning what is comfortable and routine.</p>";
