window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>At 75, Terry and Monica Darlington had done everything they could think of doing, including starting a business and becoming athletes and running a literary society. Lately they had become boating adventurers and Terry, a best-selling writer. But in their Midlands canal town in November, life was looking dull and short on surprises. Then their famous canal boat was destroyed by fire. Within a few days they had bought a new one and soon headed north in the <i>Phyllis May 2</i> - to Liverpool, Lancaster, the Pennines, and Wigan Pier. </p> <p>Terry recorded the journey, and alongside it the story of his life and his marriage and his dog Jim, with his broken ear like a flat cap, and Monicaâ€™s dog Jess, known with heart-breaking reason as the Flying Catastrophe. Funny, affecting and beautifully told, this is a story that brims with incident and excitement, and is full of the famous and fascinating people the Darlingtons have met. And there is sadness too of course - it is the true story of an adventurous life well lived.</p>";
