But Charlie perseveres and proves to be right over and over again in this story of the capture of a KGB general who is running a spy network in England. </p><p>Hayward Morse ably creates voices for each of the many characters, using a variety of convincing accents, though once in a while he doesn't shift to the correct voice. He is especially effective in his timing and makes the humor of certain situations evident. Through all the plot twists, there is never any hint of the surprising outcome.</p>";
