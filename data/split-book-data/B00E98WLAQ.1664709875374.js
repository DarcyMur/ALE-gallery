window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Audible is proud to present <i>One Summer: America, 1927,</i> the new book by Britainâ€™s favourite writer of narrative nonfiction, Bill Bryson. </p> <p>Narrated by the man himself, <i>One Summer</i> takes you to the summer when America came of age, took centre stage, and changed the world forever. In the summer of 1927, America had a booming stock market, a president who worked just four hours a day, a semi-crazed sculptor with a plan to carve four giant heads into a mountain called Rushmore, a devastating flood of the Mississippi, a sensational murder trial, and a youthful aviator named Charles Lindbergh who started the summer wholly unknown, and finished it as the most famous man on Earth. </p> <p>It was the summer of the first talking pictures, the invention of television, the peak of Al Capone's reign of terror, the ill-conceived decision that led to the Great Depression, and the thrillingly improbable return to greatness of a wheezing, over-the-hill baseball player named Babe Ruth. </p> <p>With an unforgettable cast of personalities, Bill Bryson spins a story of brawling adventure, reckless optimism, and delirious energy. What a country; what a summer; and what a writer to bring it all so vividly to life. </p> <p>Bill Bryson was born in Des Moines, Iowa, in 1951; he moved to and settled in England in 1977, working in journalism until becoming a full-time author. Bryson is much-loved for his best-selling travel books, from <i>The Lost Continent</i> to <i>Down Under,</i> and <i>Notes from a Small Island</i> earned a particularly special place in the nation's heart - a national poll for World Book Day voted it the book that best represents Britain. <i>A Short History of Nearly Everything</i> won the Aventis Prize for Science Books and the Descartes Science Communication Prize. Bryson has also written a memoir, <i>The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid,</i> and acclaimed books on language and social history (<i>Mother Tongue, Made in America, At Home</i>). </p> <p>He lives in the UK with his wife and family, and was awarded an honorary OBE for services to literature.</p>";
