As these searches intersect, he encounters a bizarre group of allies and antagonists.&nbsp;</p> <p>Gripping, prophetic, and suffused with comedy and menace, this is an astonishingly imaginative detective story, an account of a disintegrating marriage, and an excavation of the buried secrets from Japan’s forgotten campaign in Manchuria during World War II.&nbsp;</p>";
