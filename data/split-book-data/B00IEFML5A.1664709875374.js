Not long after it reaches the open sea, however, the <i>Kentucky</i> receives a launch order. After receiving that launch order, it is cut off from all counter orders and disappears into the Pacific while it makes the eight-day transit to the launch site. What the <i>Kentucky</i>'s crew doesn't know is that those launch orders didn't come from the US government.</p> <p>Rogue elements within the Mossad have learned that Iran has developed its first nuclear weapon and, in ten days, will detonate it - and the target is Israel. The suspected weapon complex is too far underground for conventional weapons to harm it, and the only choice is a preemptive nuclear strike. With limited time, this rogue group initiates a long-planned operation called the Trident Deception: They'll transmit false orders and use a US nuclear submarine to launch the attack.</p> <p>With only eight days before the <i>Kentucky</i> is in launch range and with the submarine cut off from any outside communication, one senior officer, the father of one of the officers aboard the submarine, must assemble and lead a team of attack submarines to find, intercept, and neutralize the <i>Kentucky</i> before it can unknowingly unleash a devastating nuclear attack.</p>";
