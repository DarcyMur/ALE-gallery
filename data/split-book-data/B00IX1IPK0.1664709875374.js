window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Mafia Prince is the first-person account of one of the most violent eras in Mafia history - \"Little\" Nicky Scarfo’s reign as boss of the Philly family in the 1980s - written by Scarfo’s underboss and nephew, \"Crazy\" Phil Leonetti. </p> <p>The youngest-ever underboss at the age of 31, Leonetti was at the crux of the violent downfall of the traditional American Mafia in the 1980s when he infiltrated Atlantic City after gambling was legalized, and later turned state’s evidence against his own. His testimony directly led to the convictions of dozens of high-ranking made men including John Gotti, Vincent Gigante, and his own uncle, Nicky Scarfo - sparking the beginning of the end of La Cosa Nostra. </p> <p>Just as <i>The Godfather</i> and <i>Boardwalk Empire</i> defined the early 20th century Mafia, and Wiseguy and <i>Casino</i> depicted the next great era through the ’70s, <i>Mafia Prince</i> concludes this epic genre revealing the Mafia’s violent final heyday of the 1980s straight from the horse’s mouth.</p>";
