Bomber Command's offensive against the cities of Germany was one of the epic campaigns of the Second World War. </p> <p>More than 56,000 British and Commonwealth aircrew and 600,000 Germans died in the course of the RAF's attempt to win the war by bombing. The struggle began in 1939 with a few score primitive Whitleys, Hampdens and Wellingtons, and ended six years later with 1,600 Lancasters, Halifaxes, and Mosquitoes razing whole cities in a single night. Max Hastings traced the developments of area bombing using a wealth of documnets, letters, diaries, and interviews with key surviving witnesses. <i>Bomber Command</i> is his classic account of one of the most controversial struggles of the war. Max Hastings, author of over 20 books, has been editor of the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> and the <i>Evening Standard</i>. He has received many awards for his journalism and was knighted in 2002.</p>";
