For eight years, he masqueraded as a Nazi journalist and burrowed deep into the German embassy, digging for the secrets of Hitler's invasion of Russia and the Japanese plans for the East. In a nation obsessed with rooting out moles, he kept a high profile - boozing, womanizing, and operating entirely under his own name. But he policed his spy ring scrupulously, keeping such a firm grip that by the time the Japanese uncovered his infiltration, he had done irreversible damage to the cause of the Axis. </p><p>The first definitive account of one of the most remarkable espionage sagas of World War II, <i>Target Tokyo</i> is a tightly wound portrayal of a man who risked his life for his country, hiding in plain sight.</p>";
