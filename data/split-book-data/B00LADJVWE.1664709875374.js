window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Unfolding over the course of a single year, from September 1973 to August 1974, <i>Washington Journal</i> is the record of the near-dissolution of a nation's political conscience - told from within. In this book, we see corruption in its most prosaic and grandest forms, along with occasional flashes of decency, ethics, and humanity, and other sights rarely witnessed in the wilds of the capital. </p> <p>Cool and understated - and all the more devastating for its understatement - <i>Washington Journal</i> was hailed upon its publication as a landmark work of journalism. With an introduction that brings this all-too-relevant book squarely into the present, <i>Washington Journal</i> is ready for its place in the pantheon of great writing about American politics.</p>";
