window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>One of the classic volumes of autobiography, <i>My Early Life</i> is a lively and colourful account of a young man's quest for action, adventure and danger. Churchill's schooldays are undistinguished, but he is admitted to Sandhurst and embarks on a career as a soldier and a war correspondent, seeing action in Cuba, in India, in the Sudan - where he took part in the battle of Omdurman, of which he gives us a stirring account - and finally in South Africa. </p> <p>Taken prisoner by the Boers, Churchill makes a daring escape. Back home he embarks on the political career that is to make him one of Britain's most distinguished parliamentarians. </p> <p>First published in 1930, when Churchill's most testing time still lay ahead of him, <i>My Early Life</i> is memorable both as an adventure-story and as an account of the events and influences that helped to shape the career of a great Englishman.</p>";
