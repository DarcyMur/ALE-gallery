window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>For the first time in one audio collection, all 16 <i>Yes Minister</i> radio episodes plus six further TV episodes, 14 <i>Yes Prime Minister</i> episodes and two bonus sketches. </p> <p>Between 1980 and 1988 on BBC television and radio, the exploits of the Rt Hon Jim Hacker MP (Paul Eddington) - later Prime Minister - kept the British nation enthralled. Helped - and hampered - by his diligent Permanent Secretary Sir Humphrey Appleby (Nigel Hawthorne) and his Principle Private Secretary Bernard Woolley (Derek Fowlds), Hacker and his department became synonymous with government bureaucracy and administrative double dealing. Presented here, for the first time in one collection, are the complete radio series of <i>Yes Minister</i> and the complete BBC television soundtracks of <i>Yes Prime Minister</i>. Also included are six TV soundtracks of <i>Yes Minister</i> and two special bonus mini-episodes: \"The PMâ€™s Plan\", recorded in 1984 with Margaret Thatcher as herself, and a special segment created for \"The Funny Side of Christmas\" in 1982.</p>";
