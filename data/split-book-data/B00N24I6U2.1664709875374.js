Those Mr. Big cannot possess he crushes - like his beautiful prisoner, Solitaire, and her would-be saviors James Bond and Agency man Felix Leiter. All three are marked out as victims in a trail of terror, treachery, and torture that leads from New York's underworld to the shark-infested island in the sun that Mr. Big calls his own. </p> <p>This audiobook includes an exclusive bonus interview with Rory Kinnear.</p> <p>Blackstone Audio, Inc.
