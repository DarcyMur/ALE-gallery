Now she brings her vast experience, good cheer, and finely sharpened pencils to help the rest of us in a boisterous language audiobook as full of life as it is of practical advice. <i>Between You &amp; Me</i> features Norris' laugh-out-loud descriptions of some of the most common and vexing problems in spelling, punctuation, and usage - comma faults, danglers, \"who\" versus \"whom\", \"that\" versus \"which\", compound words, gender-neutral language - and her clear explanations of how to handle them. Down-to-earth and always open minded, she draws on examples from Charles Dickens, Emily Dickinson, Henry James, and the Lord's Prayer as well as from <i>The Honeymooners</i>, <i>The Simpsons</i>, David Foster Wallace, and Gillian Flynn. She takes us to see a copy of Noah Webster's groundbreaking Blue-Back Speller, on a quest to find out who put the hyphen in Moby-Dick, on a pilgrimage to the world's only pencil-sharpener museum, and inside the hallowed halls of <i>The New Yorker</i> and her work with such celebrated writers as Pauline Kael, Philip Roth, and George Saunders.&nbsp;</p> <p>Listeners - and writers - will find in Norris neither a scold nor a softie but a wise and witty new friend in love with language and alive to the glories of its use in America, even in the age of autocorrect and spell-check. As Norris writes, \"The dictionary is a wonderful thing, but you can't let it push you around.\"</p>";
