Showcasing five key players from the past five decades - Tim Rice, Wendy Richard, Tony Hawks, Sue Perkins and Julian Clary - the collection also includes two bonus editions of the show. </p> <p>Loved for the verbal dexterity, wicked wit and competitive edge of its participants, <i>Just a Minute</i> has welcomed scores of guest players to the game since it began in 1967. Among the best remembered and most entertaining of them are Tim Rice, Wendy Richard, Tony Hawks, Sue Perkins and Julian Clary. </p> <p>This collection presents four specially selected episodes for each of them, all published for the first time, all highlighting the players at their cleverest and funniest. Two bonus episodes feature guest players who appeared on the programme only once: Una Stubbs and Miriam Margolyes. </p> <p>With episodes taken from the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s, there is strong participation from regular players of the game: Clement Freud, Kenneth Williams, Derek Nimmo, Peter Jones and Paul Merton. Others playing include Hugh Dennis, Chris Neill, Linda Smith, Kit Hesketh-Harvey, Ross Noble, Graham Norton, Stephen Fry, Jenny Eclair, Liza Tarbuck, Kenneth Robinson and Aimi Macdonald. As always, Nicholas Parsons is the capable chairman of the game. </p>";
