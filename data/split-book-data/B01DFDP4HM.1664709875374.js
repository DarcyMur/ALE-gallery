To do so he must stay one step ahead of a dangerous French rival and the threatening interference of his own brother, Mycroft. </p> <p>This latest adventure, in the style of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, sends the iconic duo from London to Paris and the icy wilds of Lancashire in a case which tests Watson's friendship and the fragility and gifts of Sherlock Holmes' own artistic nature to the limits. </p>";
