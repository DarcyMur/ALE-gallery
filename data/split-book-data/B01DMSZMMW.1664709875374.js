His hilarious chronicle of the year he spent working for Carnival Cruise Lines takes listeners down into the areas where the crew works and lives, leaving listeners gasping with laughter as they're assaulted nonstop with events that range from the absurd to the utterly bizarre. Stewards fighting over food. Cutlery allowances and other nonsensical rules. What the crew calls those onboard (no, it's not <i>passengers</i>). And, of course, the sex. An abundance of ready, willing, and able bodies eager for action on a vessel replete with nooks and crannies leads to love in some mighty strange and seemingly impossible places. </p> <p>Breezy, entertaining, and informative, <i>Cruise Confidential</i> is essential listening for those planning a cruise or for anyone who just needs a good laugh. </p> <p>Don't miss the entire Cruise Confidential series: </p> <p></p> <ul> <li><i>Cruise Confidential</i> </li> <li><i>Ship for Brains</i> </li> <li><i>Unsinkable Mister Brown</i> </li> <li><i>High Seas Drifter</i> </li> </ul> <p></p>";
