Here, he has been a mediator of the minor disputes of the locals, between competing ministers, country merchants, and seemingly every Welch eccentric throughout the region. But an unusual series of events brings unseen hostilities to light, and Evan realizes just how deep the townsfolk's passions and hostilities lie. </p> <p>While the village of Llanfair has always been at odds with the neighboring town of Beddgelert, an intriguing archeological find in the nearby hills brings that rivalry to dangerous extremes, and creates a circus of local enthusiasm and gossip. The circus quickly turns deadly, however, when Llanfair's prodigal son, Ted Morgan, announces plans to erect an amusement park over the site's excavation. Soon, Constable Evans is drawn into a whirl of cultural pride, deception, and greed, and while he's at it uncovers the town's undaunted ambition - to earn the right to the longest name in the world. </p> <p>With the warmth, charm, and wry sense of humor that won listeners' hearts in <i>Evans Above</i>, Rhys Bowen offers a delightful new installment to an already cherished mystery series: <i>Evan Help Us</i>. </p>";
