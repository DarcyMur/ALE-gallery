window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>This <i>New York Times</i> best seller is an insider's account of the fall of Richard Nixon, and has remained an indispensable source into Nixon's presidency. <i>Blind Ambition</i> is an autobiographical account of a young lawyer who accelerated to the top of the Federal power structure to become Counsel to the President at 30 years of age, only to discover that when reaching the top, he had touched the bottom. Most striking in this chronicle is its honesty. Dean spares no one, including himself. But, as <i>Time</i> noted, Dean survived, despite the opposition of powerful foe, because he had no false story to protect and he had an amazing ability to recall the truth. </p>";
