This compilation contains episodes 13 - 15: <br> <br> <b>A Lesson in Murder: </b> <br>When Jack and Sarah are called in to investigate mysterious pranks at Cherringham Girls School, it seems at first that it might be the work of a few mean pupils with a grudge.

Soon they discover that truth is often stranger than fiction, and in Combe Castle things do indeed go bump in the night... <br> <br> <b>A Fatal Fall: </b> <br>Dylan McCabe - a labourer on a rushed Cherringham building project - has been complaining about the site's lack of safety. When he's discovered dead after a fall, it seems that Dylan's own warnings were all too true.
