window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The <i>Wall Street Journal</i>'s award-winning business reporter unveils the bizarre and sinister story of how a math genius named Tom Hayes, a handful of outrageous confederates, and a deeply corrupt banking system ignited one of the greatest financial scandals in history. </p> <p>In 2006, an oddball group of bankers, traders and brokers from some of the world's largest financial institutions made a startling realization: Libor - the London interbank offered rate, which determines the interest rates on trillions in loans worldwide - was set daily by a small group of easily manipulated functionaries, and that they could reap huge profits by nudging it to suit their trading portfolios. Tom Hayes, a brilliant but troubled mathematician, became the lynchpin of a wild alliance that among others included a French trader nicknamed \"Gollum\"; the broker \"Abbo\", who liked to publicly strip naked when drinking; a Kazakh chicken farmer turned something short of financial whiz kid; a broker known as \"Village\" (short for \"Village Idiot\") and fascinated with human-animal sex; an executive called \"Clumpy\" because of his patchwork hair loss; and a broker uncreatively nicknamed \"Big Nose\". Eventually known as the \"Spider Network\", Hayes's circle generated untold riches - until it all unraveled in spectacularly vicious, backstabbing fashion. </p> <p><i>The Spider Network </i>is not only a rollicking account of the scam, but a provocative examination of a financial system that was crooked throughout, designed to promote envelope-pushing behavior while shielding higher-ups from the consequences of their subordinates' rapacious actions. </p>";
