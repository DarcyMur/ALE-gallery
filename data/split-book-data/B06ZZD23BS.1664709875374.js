He also traces his development from his first flight experiences in the air force, through his days as a test pilot, to his <i>Apollo 11</i> spacewalk, presenting an evocative description of the joys of flight as well as a new perspective on time, light, and movement from someone who has seen the fragile Earth from the other side of the moon. </p>";
