He would set out on an adventure that would lead him to question everything about man's place in the world and how humans came to be. </p> <p><i>The Voyage of the Beagle</i> is the journal Darwin kept during his travels and where he would note his observations of the extraordinary and natural wonders he encountered, from volcanoes to the coral reefs of Australia. It would be these natural wonders that would lead to him questioning how the different species of the world came to be and eventually to his radical theories, which would one day turn the world upside down with the eventual publication of <i>On the Origins of Species</i>. </p>";
