Someone at the research facility known as the Atomic is leaking secrets to Soviet Russia, and when nuclear scientist Bruno Rothesay goes missing, the British Intelligence Services are convinced he's the mole.

But if Rothesay wasn't selling secrets to the Soviets, who is? </p> <p>As Hugo digs deeper into buried connections and unlikely coincidences, he knows there's more to this case than his London superiors believe.
