While her brother James runs Naomi's Bistro, Siobhan is doing her part to keep the village safe. Of course, Kilbane is pretty quiet compared to a place like Dublin, where Macdara Flannery has gone to be a detective sergeant.</p> <p>Then one night the local priest summons Siobhan to the church cemetery. There's a dead man in the graveyard - above ground. He's a stranger, but the priest has heard talk of an American tourist in town searching for an Irish ancestor. A detective sergeant is dispatched from Dublin to assist with the case, and, as fate would have it, it's Macdara.</p> <p>Things have been awkward between him and Siobhan since he left, but their partnership soon unearths that the victim was from Dublin, Ohio. As they dig for a motive among the gnarled roots of his family tree, long-buried secrets are unearthed.</p> <p>Now, they'll have to stay two steps ahead of the killer...or they'll end up with more than one foot in the grave.</p>";
