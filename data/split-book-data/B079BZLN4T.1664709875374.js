window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Since the beginning of human history Mars has been an alluring dream - the stuff of legends, gods, and mystery. The planet most like ours, it has still been thought impossible to reach, let alone explore and inhabit. Now with the advent of a revolutionary new plan, all this has changed.&nbsp;</p> <p>Leading space exploration authority Robert Zubrin has crafted a daring new blueprint, Mars Direct, presented here with engaging anecdotes. <i>The Case for Mars</i> is not a vision for the far future or one that will cost us impossible billions.&nbsp;</p> <p>It explains step-by-step how we can use present-day technology to send humans to Mars within 10 years; actually produce fuel and oxygen on the planet's surface with Martian natural resources; how we can build bases and settlements; and how we can one day \"terraform\" Mars - a process that can alter the atmosphere of planets and pave the way for sustainable life.</p>";
