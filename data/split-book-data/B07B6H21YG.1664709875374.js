Wood encounters indigenous tribes in Mexico, revolutionaries in a Nicaraguan refugee camp, fellow explorers, and migrants heading toward the United States. The relationships he forges along the way are at the heart of his travels - and the personal histories, cultures, and popular legends he discovers paint a riveting history of Mexico and Central America.</p> <p>While contending with the region's natural obstacles like quicksand, flash floods, and dangerous wildlife, he also witnesses the surreal beauty of local landscapes, from cascading waterfalls and sunny beaches to the spectacular ridge-lines of the Honduran highlands. Finally, Wood attempts to cross one of the world's most impenetrable borders: the Darien Gap route from Panama into South America, a notorious smuggling passage and the wildest jungle he has ever navigated.</p>";
