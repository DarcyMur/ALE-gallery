Where does ambition come from? How does adversity affect the growth of leadership? Does the man make the times or do the times make the man?&nbsp;</p> <p>In <i>Leadership,</i> Goodwin draws upon four of the presidents she has studied most closely - Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Lyndon B. Johnson (in civil rights) - to show how they first recognized leadership qualities within themselves, and were recognized by others as leaders.</p> <p>No common pattern describes the trajectory of leadership. Although set apart in background, abilities, and temperament, these men shared a fierce ambition and a deep-seated resilience that enabled them to surmount uncommon adversity. At their best, all four were guided by a sense of moral purpose. At moments of great challenge, they were able to summon their talents to enlarge the opportunities and lives of others.</p> <p>This seminal work provides an accessible and essential road map for aspiring and established leaders in every field. In todayâ€™s polarized world, these stories of authentic leadership in times of apprehension and fracture take on a singular urgency.</p>";
