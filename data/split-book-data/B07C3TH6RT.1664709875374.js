But this year's event ends in a terrifying accident, and suddenly everyone wonders... Is there a real ghost loose in the hotel?

But soon they're forced to confront their own superstitions as they find themselves on the trail of an unsolved Victorian murder...</p> <p><b>FOLLOW THE MONEY</b><br> Claire and Terry Goodman seem to have everything. Successful business. Son at Oxford. New mansion right on the River Thames. And seemingly... plenty of money to spend.
