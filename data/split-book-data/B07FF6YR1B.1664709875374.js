window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In her classic, <i>In the Shadow of Man</i>, Jane Goodall wrote of her first 10 years at Gombe. In <i>Through a Window</i> she continues the story, painting a more complete and vivid portrait of our closest relatives.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>On the shores of Lake Tanganyika, Gombe is a community where the principal residents are chimpanzees. Through Goodall's eyes we watch young Figan's relentless rise to power and old Mike's crushing defeat. We learn how one mother rears her children to succeed, and another dooms hers to failure. We witness horrifying murders, touching moments of affection, joyous births, and wrenching deaths.</p> <p>As Goodall compellingly tells the story of this intimately intertwined community, we are shown human emotions stripped to their essence. In the mirror of chimpanzee life, we see ourselves reflected.</p>";
