window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The author Sri \"M\" is an extraordinary individual. His uniqueness lies not only in the fact that at the young age of 19 and a half, he travelled to snow-clad Himalayas from Kerala, and there he met and lived for several years with a \"real-time\" yogi, Babaji, but also that he should undertake such an unusual and adventurous exploration, given his non-Hindu birth and antecedents.&nbsp;</p> <p>The metamorphosis of Mumtaz Ali Khan into Sri \"M\", a yogi with profound knowledge of the Upanishads and deep personal insights, born of first-hand experiences with higher levels of consciousness is indeed a fascinating story.&nbsp;</p> <p>The bonus for those interested in the secrets of yoga, meditation, and sankhyan metaphysics is that Sri \"M\" is still living and easily reachable. He leads a normal life, married with two children, wears no special robes and conducts himself without pomp or paraphernalia.&nbsp;</p> <p>Someone who met him recently said, \"I expected a flashy godman and instead I saw a jean clad gentleman with a smile on his face, ready to discuss my problems. In five minutes flat, I said to myself, this is no ordinary man. The peace and tranquility that enters your system is tangible.\"</p>";
