So when a London dandy falls dead at her feet in the entryway of a London <i>Daily Gazette</i>, she feels no compulsion to investigate. It was a newspaper office, after all, and reporters are already on the case as are the authorities. She has her own problems to deal with anyway - such as extricating herself from a seemingly harmless little fib that has somehow grown in into a ridiculously large fiction.&nbsp;</p> <p>Truly, she has no interest at all. Except the dagger that killed the poor earl seemed disconcertingly familiar....</p> <p>And so Bea is off to the British Museum because she cannot rest until she confirms her suspicion, while trying to allay her family’s concerns and comprehend the Duke of Kesgrave’s compulsion. For the handsome lord has no reason to waste his time solving a mystery alongside a shy spinster. And yet he turns up everywhere she goes.</p>";
