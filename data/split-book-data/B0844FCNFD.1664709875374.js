However, very rarely do we hear from the women he left behind - the ones forgotten as mere footnotes in this tragedy.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>The Phantom Prince</i> chronicles Elizabeth Kendall’s intimate relationship with Ted Bundy and its eventual unraveling. As much as has been written about Bundy, it’s remarkable to hear the perspective of people who shared their daily lives with him for years. This gripping account presents a remarkable examination of a charismatic personality that masked unimaginable darkness.</p>";
