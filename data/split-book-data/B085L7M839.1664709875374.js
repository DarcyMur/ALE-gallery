And her aunt’s concern about the growing scandal around her unfortunate habit of unmasking murderers in the middle of society events isn’t entirely unfounded.</p> <p>And then, there’s the truly unfathomable appearance on her doorstep of the former Miss Brougham, the spiteful heiress whose cruel taunts derailed Bea’s social career. Remarkably, the society matron has a mystery to solve and knows Bea is the only person who can help her.&nbsp;</p> <p>A dead grandfather, a missing jewel, a cryptic letter, an opportunity to condescend to her archnemesis - the case seems simple enough. Yet, somehow, it all goes terribly, horribly wrong.</p>";
