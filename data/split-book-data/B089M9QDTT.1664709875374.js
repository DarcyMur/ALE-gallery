Over the course of 18 generously durated episodes, Partridge grants us full and unfettered access to his off-screen life (within reason).&nbsp;</p> <p>In exchange for a series of payments from Audible, he promises an access-all-areas pass to the nooks and crannies of his hinterland, to reveal a wiser, cleverer, more reflective Alan than many of his more vaunted peers have given him credit for. He then sends the resultant podcasts to Audible ensuring they meet the technical specifications laid down in the contract.</p>";
