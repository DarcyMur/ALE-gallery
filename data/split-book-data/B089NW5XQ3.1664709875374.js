Nevertheless, ex-Chief Inspector Swift persuades them, and they reach the ancient city to discover a movie crew, a spy, and a couple of mysterious ladies.</p> <p>Nobody seems to be telling the truth. They all have secrets, and there's one secret in particular that's drawn them like bees to the honeypot. But what is it? And then, there's murder, and mysteries from the ancient past and a handsome sheik who remains in the shadows.</p> <p>Heathcliff Lennox and Swift must investigate and use all their ingenuity to unravel the enigma that lies hidden deep below the dusty streets of ancient Damascus.</p> <p>Major Heathcliff Lennox is an ex-WW 1 war pilot, six feet and three inches, unruly dark blond hair, age around 30 - named after the hero of <i>Wuthering Heights</i> by his romantically minded mother - much to his great annoyance. <i>Death in Damascus</i> is the fourth book in the Lennox series.</p>";
