Lady Eleanor Swift, accidental amateur detective and retired explorer, is determined to take a break from investigating murders. So when a local politician dies suddenly at an elegant dinner party at Farrington Manor, she tries her hardest not to listen to the raft of rumors around the village that he might have been poisoned by the fudge. It’s the anniversary of the disappearance of her beloved parents, and she’s promised herself not to get mixed up with any more mysteries. She isn’t sure they’d have approved.&nbsp;</p> <p>But when she arrives home to discover that Mrs. Pitkin, the kindly cook from Farrington Manor, has been dismissed without wage or reference because the police consider her a suspect, Eleanor knows she needs to act. If there was a murder, then she needs to track down the culprit and clear Mrs. Pitkin’s name.&nbsp;</p> <p>Accompanied by her faithful partner in crime, Gladstone the bulldog, who has the best nose for sniffing out bones in the country, Eleanor sets out to find the killer. And when another body turns up and she finds poisoned fudge in the victim’s house, Eleanor knows she’s on the right track. But can she sort the truth from the lies before she becomes a witness to another murder - this time rather closer to home?&nbsp;</p> <p><b>An utterly charming cozy mystery! Warm and witty, fans of Agatha Christie, TE Kinsey, and LB Hathaway will be totally hooked.</b>&nbsp;</p>";
