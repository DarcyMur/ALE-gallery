Kitty Underhay is enjoying a restorative break from sleuthing on a visit to her family at Enderley Hall.

So, when the parish clerk is found dead on her front doorstep, Kitty leaps at the chance of distraction.&nbsp;</p> <p>The police are happy to conclude that Miss Plenderleith met her unfortunate end on a patch of ice, but Kitty isn’t convinced this was a case of bad weather and worse luck. And when the Reverend Crabtree fails to show for tea the next day, she heads to the church to speak to him. But she arrives to find the clergyman hanging from the bell rope, dead.&nbsp;</p> <p>With Matt seemingly wrapped up with his alluring Austrian, Kitty must solve the case on her own. But as she snoops into parish affairs, she makes some less-than-saintly discoveries. Just who has broken the sixth commandment? Meanwhile the killer is preparing a churchyard grave for Kitty, and she’ll have to use all her wits to avoid falling in....</p> <p><b>An addictive, absorbing Golden Age cozy murder mystery, perfect for fans of Agatha Christie, T.E.
