It’s a chaotic mix of mistrust, unfaithful fiancées, bizarre death threats, uninvited wedding guests, and a big dollop of very real unease.</p> <p>As the wedding pre-dinner party unfolds, a murderer strikes again and again. Secrets from beyond the grave are revealed, shadows of the past loom over the present, and disguises are uncovered in what has become a deadly, dangerous game of obsession.</p> <p>Can Posie and Richard uncover the murderer before others die? Or, will the truth come at a terrible price?</p> <p><i>Murder in Tuscany</i> is set against the beautiful backdrop of a sun-drenched Tuscan hilltop town, is full of intrigue and red herrings, and is the completely engrossing 11th book in the delightfully classic and glamorously entertaining Posie Parker Mystery Series. Although it can be enjoyed as a stand-alone story in its own right.&nbsp;</p> <p>This is a clean listen with no graphic violence, sex, swearing, or strong language. This is a classic murder mystery which will appeal to fans of Agatha Christie and <i>Downton Abbey</i>.&nbsp;</p> <p>!To be the first to hear about L.B.
