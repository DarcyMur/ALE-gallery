Her favorite teacher, Mrs. Wadsworth, has asked that Eleanor talk about her intrepid travels around the globe - travelling the Silk Road by bicycle, crossing the Himalayas and even befriending the Maharaja of India.

Eleanor is utterly devastated, but she owes it to her dearest teacher to find out who killed her and why. So, alongside Gladstone the bulldog, it’s best paw forward to track down a villain.</p> <p>But when the art teacher is also found dead, Eleanor is sure someone is trying to do away with the people who taught her everything. As Eleanor delves into possible motives, she discovers a clue in the most unlikely place: her mother’s old school diary. Does the route to the murderer lie within a secret passageway her mother uncovered? Can Eleanor nail the culprit in time, or is the killer coming for her next?&nbsp;</p> <p><b>A totally gripping and glamorous 1920s cozy! Fans of Agatha Christie, T.E. Kinsey, and Rhys Bowen are in for a treat.</b></p>";
