window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The classic Michael Lewis book that defined an era of greed, gluttony, and outrageous fortune, available for the first time unabridged and read by the author.&nbsp;</p> <p>In 1986, before Michael Lewis became the best-selling author of <i>The Big Short</i>, <i>Moneyball</i>, and <i>Flash Boys</i>, he landed a job at Salomon Brothers, one of Wall Street’s premier investment firms.&nbsp;</p> <p>During the next three years, Lewis rose from callow trainee to New York- and London-based bond salesman, raking in millions for the firm and cashing in on a modern-day gold rush. <i>Liar’s Poker</i> is the culmination of those heady, frenzied years - a behind-the-scenes look at a unique and turbulent time in American business. This new audio edition, produced by the same team that produces his number one podcast <i>Against the Rules</i>, is unabridged, read by the author, and features archival news clips from the era, original scoring and sound effects, as well as a bonus episode from the companion podcast.&nbsp;</p> <p>From the frat-boy camaraderie of the 41st-floor trading room to the killer instinct that made ambitious young men gamble everything on a high-stakes game of bluffing and deception, <i>Liar’s Poker</i> is both “the funniest book on Wall Street I’ve ever read” (Tom Wolfe) and the launchpad for Michael Lewis’ storied career.</p>";
