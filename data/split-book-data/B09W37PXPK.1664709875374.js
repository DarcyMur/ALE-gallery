While Richard Lovelace, chief commissioner of New Scotland Yard, tries to work out if Rufus himself is the target of a complicated plot, Posie has her own investigations to make.</p> <p>The local tragedy of a missing dancer has been dealt with by county police as an open-and-shut case. But Posie soon discovers it is anything but. And she suspects foul play.</p> <p>And as the snow falls and Christmas lights go up, secrets are revealed, and Posie becomes involved in perhaps her most personal case so far. She becomes aware that danger lurks at The Mermaid, and not just for Rufus.</p> <p><b>A murderer is on the loose.</b></p> <p>Sign up for the newsletter on lbhathaway.com</p>";
